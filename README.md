SLakathon related project materials.
The project aims to mitigate the risk of climate change on the traditional crops being grown in India and surrounding areas. It leverages the weather and soil information from the various observatories to come up with a system which will suggest crops to be sown according to the geographical conditions, taking into consideration the climatic stresses due to the anthropogenic factors.
